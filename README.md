# Backend for my digital signage -project. 

Here are all functions stored in AWS Lambda. The client connects the backend via API Gateway and then the backend does
what it needs to. 

## what it does?

It will fetch all the data the client (digital signage) need and shapes the data so that the client mainly needs only to show it.

### How can I use this?

You can't. The code is in the cloud and it needs the serverless environment to work. This is just a sample repo to show what kind of code there is. 

You can see front-end improvement from the old commits, but this is only cloned repo from the original. You can see the front-end code in another repo.
